class Student{
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address;

}


IOC Container: creates the object of a class Address and inject all the values of variables at runtime automatically.


class Address{
    String street;
    String city;
    String state;
    String country;
}

Dependency Injection can be done in 2 ways :
- Using Setter Injection (Property Injection)
- Using Constructor Injection

Setter Injection :
class Student{
    id,name,address;
    setId(id){}
    setName(name){}
    setAddress(address){}
}

class Address{
    street,city,state,country;
    setStreet(street)
    setCity(city)
    setState(state)
    setCountry(country)
}

IoC creates object of Address and calls all setter methods of address to put the values .

It also creates the object of Student and calls all the setter methods of Student and object of address to inject the values.


Constructor Injection : 

But we will notify that we use Constructor Injection in configuration file.

class Student{
    String id, name , address;
    Student(id,name,address){ }
}

class Address{
    String street,city,state,country;
    Address(street,city,state,country){ }
}

Configuration File : e.g. XML
Defines the all information in XML such as class , objects, this is called as ****beans**** 

----where we declare beans and its dependency.

Data Types :(Dependencies)
1) Primitive Data Types (byte,short,char,int,float,double,long,boolean)
2) Collection type (list,set,map,and properties)
3) Reference type (Other class object) (e.g. above code)
