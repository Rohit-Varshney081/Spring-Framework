Beans object
XML Config
application code

IoC (Inversion of Control) Container is responsible to inject dependency.
It is also responsible to instantiate the application class, to configure the object and to assemble the dependencies between the objects.

We provide metadata to IoC container either by XML file or annotation.

There are two types of IoC Container :
        1.BeanFactory
        2.ApplicationContext

ApplicationContext
    -It represents our IoC container (also have bean factor properties).

    -It is built on top of the Beanfactory interfacee.

    -It adds some extra functionality than BeanFactory such as simple integration with Spring's AOP, message resource handling (for i18n), event propagation,application layer specific context (e.g.WebApplicationContext) for web application.
