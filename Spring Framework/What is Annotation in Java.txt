Annotations are used to provide supplemental information about a program. 

    >Annotations start with ‘@’.
    >Annotations do not change the action of a compiled program.
    >Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements i.e. instance variables, constructors,        methods, classes, etc.
    >Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by the compiler. See below       code for example.
    >Annotations basically are used to provide additional information, so could be an alternative to XML and Java       marker interfaces.

There are broadly 5 categories of annotations as listed:

    Marker Annotations
    Single value Annotations
    Full Annotations
    Type Annotations
